title: Open source self-hosting and simpler pricing
date: 2020-07-08
summary: As part of our commitment to privacy we have open-sourced the Mailmask codebase to enable self-hosting. In tandem, we have also simplified our pricing scheme.
---

Up until now Mailmask operated like a "black box", where-in our customers couldn't see what was
happening under the hood. However, as of yesterday the entire Mailmask codebase is open source
and can be viewed on Github at https://github.com/hiddentao/mailmask.

Please feel free to browse through our code (or better yet, clone and run it yourself!) to verify
that it does what we say it does 😀

For those who wish to benefit from Mailmask but have total control and privacy over their emails we
have provided a [self-hosting guide](https://github.com/hiddentao/mailmask/blob/master/docs/SelfHostingGuide.md). Admittedely it's not trivial and requires some effort - we
aim to simplify the steps needed in the near future, please bear with us.

## Simpler pricing 💸

We realized that our pricing structure was complicated than it needed to be and was in
some cases making it too hard for people to decide which plan to choose.

We've now simplified it by removing the _Pro_ plan - now there is just the free _Basic_ plan and the paid _Premium_ plan.
In tandem we we have reduced the price of the _Premium_ plan down from $4 per month ($40 per year) to **$3 per month ($30 per year)**.

We hope these changes make pricing simpler to understand and more affordable.
